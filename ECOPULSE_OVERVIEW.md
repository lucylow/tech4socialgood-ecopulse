## üéØ Executive Summary

**EcoPulse** is an innovative AI-powered educational platform that transforms abstract climate science into tangible, interactive experiences. By combining natural language processing with real-time 3D visualization, EcoPulse empowers students worldwide to understand environmental impacts and explore sustainable solutions through inquiry-based learning.

### Problem Statement
Climate education remains abstract and inaccessible for many learners, particularly in underserved communities where resources are limited. 70% of students find climate change too abstract to comprehend, creating a critical gap in environmental literacy that affects 2.8 billion students globally.

### Solution
EcoPulse democratizes climate knowledge through AI-driven simulation that makes environmental impacts visible and actionable. Students can explore "what if" scenarios using natural language commands, seeing immediate visual feedback on Earth's health metrics while receiving scientifically-grounded educational insights.
