### Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) - 30 seconds

**[Visual: Start with a close-up of a student's face looking confused at a climate change graph]**

**Narrator (Voice-over):**
> "Meet Sarah, a 16-year-old student trying to understand climate change. Like 70% of students worldwide, she finds climate science too abstract to grasp."

**[Visual: Sarah scrolling through complex climate data, looking frustrated]**

**Narrator:**
> "What if we could make climate change tangible? What if students could see the direct impact of their actions on our planet?"

**[Visual: Screen transitions to EcoPulse logo with tagline]**
